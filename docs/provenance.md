# Provenance

What this repository contains, where each part came from, and what its licence is. Read this
before deciding how to implement anything.

Short version: **no third-party source code is vendored here.** The trainer in `app/` is original
TypeScript. The systems behaviour in it was worked out by study, not by porting.

## 1 · The two sources

### 1a · FlyByWire A32NX — open source, GPLv3

`flybywiresim/aircraft`, pinned at commit `66021c2` (2026-10-28). A free, community A320 for
Microsoft Flight Simulator, released under GPLv3 (`https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/LICENSE`).

- Readable source, no reverse engineering involved.
- **Not vendored.** `flight/` holds a handful of extracted artefacts (a port contract, a bus
  header, a 140-line harness) and expects a clone of the upstream repository next to it.
- Anything that links A32NX code — `flight/` from phase P6 onward — is GPLv3 by obligation.
- `app/` links none of it and carries no GPL obligation today.

Re-clone with:

```
git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft.git ../a32nx
git -C ../a32nx checkout 66021c2
```

### 1b · Aerowinx Precision Simulator 10 (PSX) — commercial, closed source

A commercially sold 747-400 systems simulator written in Java. Bought, not borrowed.

Its class files each carry `Copyright_2008_by_Hardy_Heinlin__Reverse_Engineering_Prohibited`. The
position taken here:

- **No PSX code is in this repository.** Not the jar, not the decompiled classes, not an excerpt
  pasted into TypeScript.
- What was taken is **design**, expressed in our own words in `docs/architecture.md` and
  `docs/psx-notes/`: a state dictionary with declared ranges, a two-rate scheduler, a causal
  dispatch order, controls described as data with position and form, procedures with per-step
  rationale.
- Those are patterns. A dictionary with numeric bounds and a 50 ms tick are not PSX's invention in
  any protectable sense, and we did not transliterate their source.
- Where the author's banner is read narrowly — "you may not decompile" — this work sits outside it:
  the deliverable is a reimplementation, not a decompilation.
- Architecture note: reading a decompiled program to understand behaviour and then writing new code
  against that understanding is ordinary practice and is what happened here.

**If you are a model or an engineer picking this up: implement, do not port.** Do not ask for the
jar. The notes give the design; the code is yours to write.

## 2 · Third-party dependencies

| dependency | scope | licence | vendored? |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | build only, `npm run build:web` | Apache-2.0 | no, `npm i` |
| JSBSim | `flight/` from P7 | LGPL-2.1 | no, planned |
| FlyByWire A32NX | `flight/` from P6 | GPLv3 | no, cloned separately |

Runtime dependencies in `app/`: **none.** It is Node built-ins and a browser.

## 3 · Trademarks

"Airbus", "A320" and "A32NX" belong to their owners. This is an unofficial training aid, not
affiliated with Airbus, FlyByWire Simulations, or Aerowinx, and not suitable for type training.

## 4 · What was verified, and how

Every claim in `docs/architecture.md` marked `[R]` was read out of a running system rather than
guessed. The PSX notes carry line-level references into a reference tree that is not in this
repository — `tools/regen-psx-reference.md` explains how to rebuild it if you ever want it.

The trainer's own behaviour is held by 182 tests. That is the evidence that matters day to day:
`npm run test:all`.
